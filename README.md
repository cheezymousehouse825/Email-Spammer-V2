# Email-Spammer-V2

To use if someone is getting on your nerves (please don't abuse it)

## Installation

You can download the python files and install all the libraries, or you can go to the [releases tab](https://github.com/cheezymousehouse825/Email-Spammer-V2/releases/)

## Directions

Make some gmail accounts and allow them to be used by [Less secure apps](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps), then run the settings file. Put in the usernames of the accounts you just made, the passwords of the accounts you just made, and the recipients, and finally, the message you would like sent. Once you have the settings down, you can run the main file. You should just see a black box, and it will spam people until you close the window.

## **Important**

Please don't use this seriously, it is only for education.

**Your gmail passwords will be stored in the json file, if you don't want people to be able to see it, please delete the json file (you will have to update the settings every time when you do this)**
